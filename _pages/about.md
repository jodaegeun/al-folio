Hello! Thanks for dropping by.

I'm a Ph.D. student in <a href="http://ph.postech.ac.kr/eng/main/main.php" target="_blank">Department of Physics</a> at <a href="http://www.postech.ac.kr" target="_blank">Pohang University of Science and Technology (POSTECH)</a>. 

Currently I work in <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/hwllab/" target="_blank">Theoretical Nanoscale Transport Lab (TNTL)</a> and study condensed matter physics theory. 

My research interest is to describe the transport of spin and orbital in solids, especially, the Berry phase effects emerging from the orbital degree of freedom.
